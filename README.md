# Electric Kart Simulation (Academic Project)

This repository contains the work completed as part of a **modeling course at EiCNAM**.  
The project focuses on developing and testing a **simple** simulation model of an **electric kart**, emphasizing system-level understanding and component interaction.

---

## Project Objectives

- **Model various components** of an electric vehicle, including the motor, battery, and drivetrain.  
- **Incorporate external forces** such as aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and gradient effects.  
- **Validate the overall system** by running the model through a defined **drive cycle** to observe performance and energy behavior.

## Tools & Environment

- **Software:** MATLAB/Simulink (or equivalent modeling tool)  
- **Focus:** System-level modeling, dynamic simulation, performance evaluation
